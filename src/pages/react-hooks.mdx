# React Hooks

A set of reusable hooks to use in your react components and make life easier, cheers!

Note that this packages uses React Hooks released in `react@16.8.0`. So use this version of react or greater.

## Usage

This package contains a set of named exports and no default export is provided.

> This package is distributed as an ESM package and if you use a modern javascript bundler (eg. Webpack, Rollup or Parcel) the source code will be tree-shaked and only the hooks you use will be included in your final (production) bundle.
